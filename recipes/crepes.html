        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>½ cup milk</li>
            <li>½ cup water</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk flour and eggs together in a large mixing bowl; gradually add in milk and water, stirring to combine. Add salt and melted butter; beat until smooth.  </li>
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crêpe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.  </li>
            <li>Cook until the top of the crêpe is no longer wet and the bottom has turned light brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Run a spatula around the edge of the skillet to loosen the crêpe; flip and cook until the other side has turned light brown, about 1 minute more. Serve hot. </li>
        </ol>
